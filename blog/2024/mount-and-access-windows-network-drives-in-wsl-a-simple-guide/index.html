This guide provides a straightforward method for mounting Windows network drives in WSL, covering both temporary and permanent mounting.</p> <h3>Quick and Temporary Mounting</h3> <p>To temporarily access a Windows network drive within WSL, follow these steps:</p> <p><strong>1. Identify the Drive Letter:</strong> First, identify the letter of the Windows network drive you wish to access. For demonstration purposes, we will use M: as our drive letter.</p> <p><strong>2. Prepare the Mount Point:</strong> If a corresponding folder for your drive letter does not exist under /mnt in WSL, create one with the command:</p> <pre>mkdir /mnt/m</pre> <p><strong>3. Mount the Drive:</strong> Use the following command to mount the drive, allowing access until logoff:</p> <pre>xsudo mount -t drvfs M: /mnt/m</pre> <h3>Setting Up Persistent Mounts</h3> <p>For continuous access to a network drive, you can configure the system to mount automatically at login:</p> <p><strong>1. Verify the Mount Point Exists:</strong> Ensure the existence of the mount target folder (e.g., /mnt/m).</p> <p><strong>2. Edit the </strong>fstab<strong> File:</strong> Open the file /etc/fstab and append the following line to enable automatic mounting:</p> <pre>M: /mnt/m drvfs defaults 0 0</pre> <p><strong>3. Apply the Changes:</strong> To apply the changes, execute:</p> <pre>sudo mount -a</pre> <p>This guide aims to facilitate the integration of Windows network drives into the WSL environment, streamlining file management across both systems.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=bef22e4aa288" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
