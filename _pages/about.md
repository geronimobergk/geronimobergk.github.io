<p class="lead">I work on machine learning systems that must operate under hard real-world constraints — limited energy, data, and compute — while remaining reliable and accountable in practice. My focus is translating learning algorithms into deployable systems, where robustness, evaluation, and system integration matter more than peak benchmark performance.</p>

<p>I am currently a Managing Consultant in Data Science at Horváth, where I design and deploy data-driven decision systems in large-scale enterprise environments. Previously, I was a Research Associate at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute (HHI), working on machine-learning-based forecasting, telemetry, and control for communication systems under operational constraints. I developed reproducible simulation tools and large-scale datasets for optical networks, integrated learning components into real-time system demonstrators, and contributed to benchmark-driven evaluation pipelines. This work resulted in seven peer-reviewed publications at leading venues including OFC, ECOC, and JOCN, and was recognized with the Fraunhofer HHI Emerging Scientist Award for an outstanding master’s thesis.</p>

  <p>My work is guided by a system-level perspective, combining technical excellence and ownership to build learning-enabled systems that operate reliably under real-world constraints.</p>
