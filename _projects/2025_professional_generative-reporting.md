## Problem

Financial reporting was manual, time-consuming, and difficult to adapt to ad-hoc management questions, limiting the usefulness of available data for decision-making.

## Context

The system had to improve speed and adaptability without compromising correctness, traceability, or existing reporting standards.

## System

## Constraints

- High requirements on correctness, traceability, and interpretability
- Existing workflows and reporting standards could not be disrupted
- Output needed to be suitable for executive decision contexts
- Generative models had to be constrained and controlled

## Approach

Designed and implemented a generative reporting system integrated into existing workflows with structured prompts, validation checks, and controlled output formats.

## Outcome

A blueprint for broader rollout that preserves auditability and decision relevance.
