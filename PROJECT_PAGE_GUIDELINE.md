## Project Pages: Short Writing Guideline

### Goal

Write to prove **research judgment**, not to list work.
A reader should quickly answer: _Can this person frame a real problem, work within constraints, and draw honest conclusions?_

### Non-negotiables

- **One core message per project**
- Lead with **constraints**, not cleverness
- Emphasize **findings and decisions**, not toolchains
- **Limitations > hype**
- Write technically literate

### Default Structure (use when in doubt)

1. **Summary (3–5 sentences)**
   What you investigated → under what conditions → what changed → why it matters.

2. **Problem (1 short paragraph)**
   What was unreliable/unknown/misleading, and why it matters.

3. **Approach (1–2 short paragraphs, constraints-first)**
   Key design choices + constraints + what you intentionally didn’t do.

4. **Key Findings (3–5 bullets)**
   Concrete, falsifiable statements (cause/effect when justified).
   Good patterns: “Changing X alone caused Y”, “Effect disappears under Z”.

5. **Implications & Limitations (short paragraph or bullets)**
   What this means, where it won’t generalize, what’s unresolved.

### Pick the Structure by Project Type (don’t force one template)

- **Hypothesis-driven study:** add _Research Question / Hypothesis / Evaluation_ (defensible like a paper).
- **Exploratory / diagnostic research:** keep it lean; focus on failure modes and insights (no artificial hypotheses).
- **Systems / professional / demonstrators:** use _Context → System Design → Trade-offs → Validation → Outcomes/Lessons_ (integration > experiments).

### Style Rules

- Direct voice: “This project shows…”
- No hype adjectives, no marketing language
- No library-level detail; name tools only if essential
- Numbers only with context (protocol, baseline, conditions)

### Final Check

After reading, someone should be able to:

- Explain it in **one sentence**
- See **uncertainty and limits**
- Believe you could defend
